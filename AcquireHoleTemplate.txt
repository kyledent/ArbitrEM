# First, setup imaging conditions for the LD View preset
# Run script over a representative specimen hole (not an empty hole).
# Center hole by holding the Right mouse button and shifting the cross-hair.
# Under Camera Controls --| Setup, crop the View to eliminate neighbouring holes.
# Rerun the script to acquire the centered image, repeat if necessary. 
# Perfect centering of the template hole is not necessary.
