# ArbitrEM
SerialEM scripts for single-particle cryoEM data-collection 'ad arbitrium'

The ArbitrEM workflow enables the user to collect high-magnification micrograph exposure movies ad arbitrium, i.e. enabling regions of interest to be targeted at whim. Relatively low magnification ‘view-maps’ (derived from images recorded using the SerialEM low-dose (LD) ‘View’ imaging preset) are acquired so that specific regions on the specimen mesh can be targeted with an accuracy of up to ± 30 nm using a series of beam-image shift displacements of up to 2.5 µm calculated per view-map. A high degree of accuracy is achieved by taking into account the offset of the specimen stage re-alignment. 

The release is currently in 'alpha' and is very much a work in progress.
